Welcome to the repository for the **NGMS Career Day** presentation! This project hosts an interactive notebook designed to introduce middle school students to the world of technology and open source.

## 📚 About This Talk

This presentation was created for the Career Day at **[Insert School Name, e.g., North Gwinnett Middle School]**. Unlike a static slide deck, this repository uses a Jupyter Notebook to allow for live code execution, making the session interactive and engaging for students.

**Primary Goals:**
* **Demystify Tech:** Explain what a career in [Software Engineering/Data Science] actually looks like.
* **Interactive Learning:** Show "code in action" rather than just talking about it.
* **Inspire:** Encourage students to explore STEM fields and open source communities.
